  - Enter a name for the role, e.g. **lambda-cli-role** and click *Create Role*.
  - Click on the created role. There you can see the ARN. Copy it and save it to the file [config.json](../main/config.json) into the object `aws`, `arn_role`.

  - Click on *Create access key* and note down the *Access key ID* and the *Secret access key*, you need them later for login with the CLI

#### Remark

If you want to use the regions *me-south-1, Middle East (Bahrain)* and *ap-east-1, Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)* you will have to manually activate them in the AWS console in the browser. See [https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account?AWS-Regions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account?AWS-Regions)

You also need to append them to 'aws.regions_options' in the `main/config.json` until the cleanup issue where non-active regions let the cleanup operation fail.
